我们自主组装了一款三轮差速驱动小车，该小车具备两轮驱动功能。安装的MPU-6050模块，使得小车能够判断自身姿态并自动进行调整，实现了高度自适应的。装载的摄像头，结合图像处理技术，识别并避开障碍物，确保了其在复杂环境中的稳定运行。

We independently assembled a three-wheeled differential drive vehicle, which features a two-wheel drive function. The installed MPU-6050 module allows the vehicle to determine its own posture and automatically adjust, achieving a high level of self-adaptation. The mounted camera, combined with image processing technology, identifies and avoids obstacles, ensuring stable operation in complex environments.
